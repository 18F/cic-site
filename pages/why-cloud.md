Why is government so focused on cloud adoption? It’s because cloud provides a new model of IT delivery — one that can save agencies time, effort, labor, and worry, freeing them up to better deliver on their mission. There are many benefits to cloud computing, but below are some of the most commonly cited.

## You’re responsible for less

Before cloud computing, if you wanted compute, storage, and other IT services you first needed to buy everything yourself: physical servers, network equipment, racks, cabling, etc. Then in a secure, air conditioned and climate controlled room (something you had to figure out yourself), you would take your recently bought IT equipment and unpack it, install it, connect it, configure it, assign it, manage it, and monitor it. When something broke, it was your job to fix it; when something became obsolete, it was your job to update it. 

With cloud computing, your organization can provision powerful compute, storage, other IT services, and even software running in the data centers of cloud service providers (CSPs). Rather than buy and manage everything yourself, you can simply rent only what you need — the cloud is just someone else’s computer. 

## You benefit from economies of scale

An individual agency can never match the level of scale that a large CSP can — and nor should they want to. Just as it’s your job to deliver on mission objectives, it’s a CSP’s job to build, maintain, and optimize infrastructure, operations, and software across their networks.

The economies of scale available with the cloud allows CSPs to purchase and refresh large volumes of infrastructure constantly and at very low costs. Customers then reap the benefits of decreasing cloud costs, increased performance, better security from improved infrastructure, and enhanced functionality through system-wide innovation.

## You can optimize your entire IT portfolio

A cloud readiness assessment is an important part of any cloud migration strategy. During that assessment, you can evaluate the usefulness (how often is each system used, and is it even aligned with the business anymore?) and repetitiveness of functionality (are several systems performing the same function across the enterprise?) in your application layer. This evaluation can help to determine what should use existing commercial software in the cloud, what should be ported to the cloud, what should be consolidated, and what should be shut down entirely. Remember that there are inherently more options within the cloud, so you can create the right resource based on your needs.

Because of cloud’s functionality, this kind of assessment can continue post-migration. You may be able to get new insights about system usage, composition, and structure via your CSP’s tools — insight that you may not already have from your existing data centers. 

## You can reduce your project backlog

In traditional IT environments, servers are a bottleneck because they limit resources based on costs, security controls, or the level of operations staffing. Virtualization significantly reduces that barrier, and [true cloud deployments]({{ site.baseurl }}/why-cloud/basics/) reduce it more — making it easier to get support for your backlog of development projects, proofs-of-concept, pilots, and testing environments. Note: while faster development times are a plus, organizations need to also account for any resultant increased costs. You may benefit by stressing value to senior leadership, in addition to cost (e.g., spend 10% more, but get 50% more in delivery).

## You can keep better track of your work

In a traditional environment, much of the configuration is manual — figuring out who changed what when can be a challenge. But using configuration as code, a process both infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) solutions allow, you can automatically keep track of the who, what, and when of your changes. That’s especially helpful in terms of audits (should this person have made the change?) and governance (are these the changes we’d like to have made?). 

## You may (eventually) make cost savings

Many IT leaders say that the number one business driver for migrating to the cloud is a better return on investment (ROI), but it can be difficult to gauge ROI if your current setup isn’t priced at service levels. Even if you can gauge ROI, due to the cost of migration itself it might take years to realize a positive ROI — and those savings might be the result of pruning inefficiencies during the migration itself. Other indicators, like the ones listed above, are better for your business case or for convincing stakeholders within your organization to invest in cloud. 

However, one notable exception is software as a service (SaaS). Because you’re responsible for so little of the upkeep and improvement, SaaS licenses — especially for things like e-mail — are likely to be cheaper than running your own datacenter.

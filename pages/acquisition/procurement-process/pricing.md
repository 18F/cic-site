Because cloud is built around services, not products, it can be difficult to compare vendors apples-to-apples. Each cloud service provider (CSP) will offer different functionality, will be backed up by different infrastructure configurations, and will offer billing in different units. The more customizable your [cloud model](/why-cloud/basics/), the more complicated these calculations are likely to be — software as a service (SaaS) solutions are typically sold via individual fixed-price licenses, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solutions are typically metered, and platform as a service (PaaS) solutions can be either (and sometimes both).

While cloud’s pricing structure is different than other products or services you may have worked with before, there are ways to make these differences work on your behalf. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you consider your investment in cloud.

* **Government pricing is different from public pricing**. As a rule, government prices must be equal to the lowest commercial price. You can use what’s available publicly as a baseline, but you’ll likely need to talk to the vendor directly to find out your actual projected costs. This becomes particularly relevant when you start working with resellers, who serve as go-betweens for government and industry and negotiate their own special prices.


* **Don’t expect costs to be locked-in**. Just as items in stores go on sale, the price of cloud services fluctuates over time. This is a good thing; a competitive field of CSPs and increasingly optimized technology will typically lead to lower prices for you and your team. 


* **Do the math when you can**. Keep an eye on the units of measurement vendors use. You may not be able to make a perfect one-to-one comparison, but if one CSP charges per hour and another per minute, multiplying or dividing by 60 can help you bring both prices in line with each other. For metered service, you may have to structure your procurement to include a not-to-exceed (NTE) ceiling of the maximum a contract can spend on a particular service or a group of bundled services. For firm fixed price, you will need to estimate the number of units (i.e. users) you will need.


* **Think about the services that meet your needs**. In addition to overall costs, pay special attention to pricing for the services you’re likely to need most and how much flexibility there is to procure additional services if needed. For instance, a CSP with low prices generally but high prices for storage may not be a good fit for an agency planning to store a significant amount of data; a CSP selling very limited access may not be ideal for an agency still figuring out what it needs.


* **Ask about extras**. CSPs are businesses, and their bottom line relies on your financial support. Ask potential vendors about things like multi-year discounts, training for your staff, personal assistance with your transition onto cloud, or even ways to optimize your setup to minimize costs. After all, the worst anyone can say is no.

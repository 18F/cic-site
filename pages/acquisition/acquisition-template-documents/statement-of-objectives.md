## Cloud migration services

### Overview of migration phases

#### What is a SOO?
A  Statement of Objectives (SOO) is a government prepared document incorporated into the Request for Proposal (RFP) that states the overall solicitation objectives.  It is often provided in lieu of a Statement of Work (SOW), or instructs the offeror to create a SOW or Performance Work Statement (PWS) to address the objectives stated in the SOO.   

#### What is In a SOO? 
The SOO should provide the basic, top level objectives of the acquisition.  From the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), a SOO should contain at minimum: Purpose; Scope; Period and Place of Performance; Background; Performance Objectives (i.e. required results); and any operating constraints.

#### Why a SOO? 
A SOO shifts the responsibility for preparing the SOW from the government to the solicitation respondents.  It can be used in those solicitations where the intent is to provide the maximum flexibility to each offeror to propose an innovative development approach.  

#### How Can I Use This SOO Template?
This SOO template is used to create an acquisition-specific SOO to procure cloud migration services.  Text written in brackets and italics are optional and should be tailored (edited or deleted) to fit the needs of your Agency.  The five phases of migration are as follows: 
* Inventory

* Application Mapping

* Migration Planning

* Migration Execution

* Decommissioning Services, Equipment Disposition, Facility Disposition

Phases 1-3 were combined into a single document due to their related steps and frequent combination in the same acquisition.  This SOO template can be tailored to the cloud migration services that your agency needs.  For example, if you only are looking to procure Migration Planning services, delete all of the red text associated with ‘Inventory’ or ‘Application Mapping’ phases.

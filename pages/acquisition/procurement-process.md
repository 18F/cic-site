As established in the [Basics](/why-cloud/basics/) section, there is no one “cloud” — rather, there are a handful of cloud types and cloud models. Cross that with the fact that government uses multiple types of contracts and offers multiple ways of purchasing, and you’ll find that there’s no shortage of options for getting cloud deployed at your agency. You’ll want to conduct market research — about both what cloud solutions meet your mission needs and which acquisition strategies can get you those services.

## Determine your mission needs

Your acquisition team are experts, and they — along with resources like GSA’s [Assisted Acquisition Services](https://aas.gsa.gov/index.html) and 18F’s [acquisition services](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/acquisition-services/) — can help shepherd the process along. But generally speaking, you’ll have to consider the following things before you can successfully procure a cloud solution.

* **Do you want to buy cloud technology and cloud services together or separately**? This may help you decide which purchasing vehicles to choose or which types of contracts will meet your needs.


* **Do you want everything to come from one vendor**? While it can seem like an easier choice upfront, getting everything from one supplier can lead to problems down the line. By procuring from multiple vendors and joining cloud services up, you can help make sure you get the best services for your team while avoiding vendor lock-in.


* **What will work best for your agency**? Finding the right tech is only half the battle — you also need to navigate your own internal processes. Ask your acquisition team what’s worked for them so far, especially if they’ve already bought cloud products or services for someone else within the organization.

* **Which cloud deployment do you want**? Take a look at your security needs and determine if you take advantage of a public (or government cloud) or if you’ll need to leverage a private cloud for sensitive assets. Read more about these options on our [Basics](/why-cloud/basics/) page.

* **Which cloud model do you need**? You’ll first need to see which [products](/cloud-solutions/) meet your need. You can then determine if those solutions are infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), or software as a service (SaaS). SaaS solutions may be easier to procure than other models because [FedRAMP](https://fedramp.gov/) offers a separate authorization program for what they call "[low-impact software as a service](https://tailored.fedramp.gov/).”

## Develop an acquisition strategy
Once you’ve got these questions answered, you can start making decisions about what kind of procurement you want to make. Every agency is different, but if you’re purchasing from GSA, here are the major considerations. 

* **Which vehicle will you choose**? At GSA, cloud services are available via [IT Schedule 70](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/it-schedule-70) and [governmentwide acquisition programs (GWACs)](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-purchasing-programs/governmentwide-acquisition-contracts-gwacs).  Each has their advantages — for example, GWACs offer lower prices via pooled purchases, while Schedule 70 has a broader range of products and services available.


* **Will you bundle technology with labor**? It’s possible to procure both tech and assistance at the same time. Depending on your agency’s needs, this may or may not be necessary. For more, take a look at our sample [Statement of Objectives on Cloud Migration Services](/templates/statement-of-objectives/).

* **Which type of contract should you use**? Just as in the rest of government, there are three types of contract: firm-fixed-price (FFP), cost reimbursement, and time and materials (T&M). Once again, there are advantages and disadvantages to each; for example, FFP contracts are simpler but won’t ever let you underspend if you need less resource than you anticipated.

* **Will you buy directly or through a cloud service reseller**? Some cloud services are directly available on GSA IT Schedule 70, and some are available via resellers who can help you access discounted pricing rates.

Thereâ€™s one problem that often blocks government from even getting started with the cloud: procurement. Getting a single cloud account can take six or more months.

Buying cloud is difficult because it's an entirely different business model than federal IT typically deals with. Usage-based pricing, intermediaries, commoditization and compliance can complicate and slow down the acquisition process.

Although there are hurdles to buying cloud, there are also strategies that can help. Understanding the issues at play can help you get through procurements successfully and efficiently, ensuring you get the products and services you need while saving taxpayer money.

    summary: How to build a cloud-ready culture at your agency

Acquisition is one of the biggest challenges agencies face when trying to get on the cloud. This is because cloud relies on consumption-based payment (i.e., pay only for what you use), while government relies on consistent, predictable billing models. The structures of government — some of which are required by law — often seem incompatible with the quick-moving pace of the private sector. This leads to frustration on the vendor side (as they’d like to move faster) and concern on the contracting side (as they need to make sure they’re following the rules). 

Here are some tips to keep in mind as you work with your contract officers. 

* **Understand the limits**. Current financial management systems weren’t designed for commercial cloud computing models; in fact, they work directly against the intended business advantages of cloud computing. If progress is slow, it isn’t because contracting officers are being contrary — it’s because they’re trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
* **Research different vehicles**. There are multiple ways to acquire cloud solutions, and each has its own strengths. Within GSA alone you can choose from IT Schedule 70, government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs), and software blanket purchase agreements (BPAs). 
* **Explore Acquisition Gateway**. Acquisition Gateway offers resources and contacts for both contract officers and buyers. Within the tool you can see current and past successful contracts, as well as points of contact to learn more.
* **Share best practices**. The Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) has created the Cloud Adoption Survival Tips, Lessons Learned, and Experiences (CASTLE) guide, an extensive resource for acquisition professionals. Ask your contracting officers if they’ve seen it, and if not feel free to share.

Although it can be confusing, government cloud acquisition is definitely possible — agencies across government are acquiring and implementing cloud systems every day.

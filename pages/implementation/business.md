The best cloud transitions aren’t just about technology — they’re about people and processes, too. Reinventing your IT is an opportunity to reinvent your culture, too, and to make your ways of working as modern as the systems you use.

Here are some things to keep in mind as you move from on-prem to cloud solutions. They can help clarify your path forward, build buy-in for what you want, and keep teams motivated in times of uncertainty.

- **Take chances.** By its very nature (and by the regulations which guide it), government has a more risk-averse culture than the private sector. But change isn’t possible unless you’re willing to try something new. Whether it’s bringing a proposal to your manager, building a business case for investment, or asking for skills training, the first step towards IT modernization is rethinking what’s possible.

- **Make the right case.** If you’re trying to build support for cloud migration, remember that the things that convince you might not be the things that convince others. Before you bring cloud to someone, ask yourself: Who am I talking to? What are the things they worry about in their job? How might cloud technology ease some of those worries?

- **Build a culture.** [Devops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) are designed to work hand in hand with modern technologies. There are many software as a service (SaaS) products that can make your work easier to organize and manage, as well as practices that can strengthen the ways that your teammates work together.

- **Make improvements visible.** If something’s better because of your cloud migration, don’t keep it a secret. Tell the story of your success, and think about how that improvement could be leveraged across the organization. Could other teams benefit from how you’re working? Could another department use a SaaS product you’ve stumbled upon? One agency CTO reinvested his cost savings into dual monitors for the whole agency — a sign of success that’s impossible to ignore.

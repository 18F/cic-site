Many organizations have made a migration with the assistance of a cloud expert, but have been left to fend for themselves after the initial migration was complete. Having the right people with the right skills can help you prevent insecure configurations, outages, and lack of full functionality.

## Existing staff

Traditional operations and staff typically aren’t equipped to maintain a cloud environment. Operations staff may have a hard time thinking of services instead of servers and storage; development staff may be familiar with build tools and services, but lack the networking knowledge to make the environment work. Additionally, because the tasks needed to maintain a cloud environment are different than those needed to maintain one on-prem, skillsets will need to change.

## New skills

Effective cloud management requires adding new roles to existing job duties or creating new positions. For example, in a traditional IT environment, cost containment is usually an up-front exercise (i.e., ensuring the server is acquired for the best price). However, in a cloud environment, it is an ongoing duty — someone should be assigned to ensure that server sizes are not over-allocated or idly running. Management can be controlled manually, by scripting, or by using an automated tool, and each scenario requires an individual to manage the process. Managing hard and soft resource limits imposed by the cloud service provider (CSP), communicating thresholds to staff, and increasing soft limits before exhausting them are all tasks you’ll need staff to take on.

Some CSPs may force IT staff used to a heavy graphical user interface environment to learn a command line interface (CLI) and a scripted language to effectively manage resources. This is a whole new way of working, in addition to a new set of tasks, and requires time and patience to master.

And finally, keeping up with new service rollouts from the CSP and how it impacts the environment is a role in and of itself. For an example of the number of changes CSPs can have, see AWS8 and Azure9 updates.

System administrators and other IT staff involved in the maintenance of physical hardware may worry about lack of skills or job loss with a move to the cloud. However, IaaS still requires server and networking knowledge. Staff can acquire these premium in-demand skills, and in return will be released from the physical location requirements of their jobs. Funding for proper training may be a challenge, so organizations need to be ready to invest surge training funds to launch a cloud effort with existing staff.

## Contracted cloud professionals

In addition to retraining current staff, you may want to call on the services of contracted cloud professionals. However, make sure you choose suppliers with public sector expertise or who are knowledgeable of the unique restrictions government faces. Otherwise, you may end up with professionals who are adept at developing solutions based only on a commercial toolbox of CSP services. This is less than ideal for those suppliers, too; you may be paying for an expert who has a full breadth of cloud service skills, but only using a fraction of that knowledge.

Only some CSP services will be FedRAMP approved. Choosing a vendor outside of that category is possible, but will require additional agency resources (funding) for certification and accreditation.

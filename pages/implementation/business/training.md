Moving applications and systems to the cloud — even basic functionality like email — does not eliminate the need for trained IT professionals within an agency. However, this shift does mean that both federal employees and contractors will have to substantially augment their skills.

It may be tempting to switch your current workers out for employees who already have these skills, but this is rarely a good idea. Federal regulations, contract language, and general HR logistics often make adding or removing workers within government a prolonged process. What’s more, it’s terrible for morale and risks your losing an enormous amount of valuable institutional knowledge.

Instead, plan early and well about how to optimize your current workforce for success with your future cloud solution. Think about the best mix current and new people who can provide the best value to the organization.

The [Data Center Optimization Initiative](https://datacenters.cio.gov/) (DCOI) conducted research with agencies to learn more about the challenges of upskilling around cloud. The teams they surveyed felt that staffing was one of the most — if not the most — costly components of the cloud adoption experience. 

Agencies felt their workforces’ expertise limited the extent of possibilities available to them in the cloud, but efforts to expand their staffing resources threatened to be financially excessive. They grappled with moving to the cloud using an IT workforce that was well-versed in traditional data center operations. Ultimately, those who were most satisfied with their cloud experiences made the decision early to match a cloud solution to their existing data center staff assets. 

These agencies did not necessarily have the lowest costs nor the highest cloud adoption rate. Rather, their high satisfaction rates stemmed from positive experiences in both the cloud migration process and the eventual permanent cloud environment. That’s because these agencies did not have to undergo the burdensome process of hiring new employees because they selected solutions that fit their existing employees’ skillsets. Consequently, there was no harm to workplace morale based on fear of job losses, and the time and money saved by avoiding the hiring process could be reallocated to the technical aspects of the migration.

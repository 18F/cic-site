Overseeing a smooth transition and developing ways to handle challenges during the process are two key aspects of any successful cloud migration. This is the human side of cloud migration — taking care of your staff, not just your technology.

Change brings uncertainty, and uncertainty can bring fear. For example, staff at current data centers may believe that, as the migration to the cloud continues, they will lose job security due to greater efficiency or due to a lack of technical knowledge needed to maintain the new cloud environment.

However, there are things agencies can do to address people’s concerns. Agency leadership should develop methods to bring staff on board by listening to what they have to say and addressing their concerns directly. Consider bringing in cloud vendors to explain the security strengths of cloud services, providing training to build capacity, and emphasizing that staff can remain relevant despite the changing environment by highlighting how they will fit into the future state. Furthermore, frame your migration strategy as an opportunity for staff to gain new set of skills.

Agency leadership may have their own concerns, especially around attrition. Gaining new cloud skills could make staff more likely to leave federal service; alternatively, some staff may opt to leave agencies instead of being re-trained. Without a proper knowledge transfer, agencies may lose significant domain knowledge as staff, both federal and contractors, leave federal service.

Establishing migration teams with clear responsibilities and mandates (e.g., procurement, cybersecurity, data transfer) and assigning motivated people to the right teams can ease the adoption of a migration strategy. As a result, an agency will have units with a singular focus on specific migration tasks with the flexibility and capacity to handle tasks and challenges as they appear. Relying on ad hoc processes can become an obstacle in migration as the scale, speed, and complexity increase. Agencies that create specific and detailed processes are better positioned to control costs and save time.

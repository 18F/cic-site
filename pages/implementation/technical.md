Before you can transition systems to the cloud, you need to know what systems you currently have in place. An accurate and complete inventory and assessment of your assets is important for IT management and critical for successfully migrating those assets to the cloud. 

Ideally you want to have this information for every single IT asset you’re currently responsible for, but because of the complexity of IT doing so may be difficult at best and impossible at worst. Instead of trying to do everything at once, start with a pilot — if you’re moving a single system to the cloud, just focus on the assets you have that touch that system.

Inventory and assessment can be split into three discrete stages. First is the inventory itself: document and organize all your existing IT assets. Where, physically, is your tech? How does it interact with other systems? Who’s responsible for it? This information can be gathered both from stakeholders and from automated scans.

Once you’ve documented your existing assets, move to rationalization. What’s the business case for the systems you have? (In other words, are they still serving the purpose they served when you acquired them?) Do they need to be moved to the cloud, kept on-prem, merged with other duplicative systems, or shut down entirely? Do they need re-engineering, or are they optimal as-is?

After you know this, the final step is actually planning for migration. This includes risk assessments and financial considerations. What can you afford to do now, and what can be budgeted for in the new fiscal year? What’s a good system to use as a pilot — something that can accommodate your learning curve?

If this isn’t work you have capacity to do on your own, there are vendors who can help support you. At the request of OMB, GSA has developed a set of [statement of objectives (SOO)](/acquisition/templates/statement-of-objectives/) templates you can use to acquire migration support for things like assessment, planning, execution, and decommissioning. They’re available in our [templates](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/18f/cic-site/dev/acquisition/templates/) section.

But whether you take it on yourself or bring in outside help, all agencies — regardless of their existing network documentation — should map out their enterprise networks when they decide to move to the cloud. Many agencies thought they knew their networks were surprised when they entered the discovery phase and found unknown endpoints or unexpected traffic patterns.

If you’re used to a traditional IT environment, you’re probably also used to having to maintain a traditional IT environment. That means installing machines, updating software, monitoring everything, and fixing anything that goes wrong.

Even at the highest levels of customization, what you put on the cloud will require less maintenance than what you have on-prem. That’s because your cloud service provider (CSP) will be taking care of at least your infrastructure and, in some cases, everything down to the code. Just like with compliance, the level of maintenance required of you depends on how deeply you’ve adopted cloud — and if you can customize it, you’re probably responsible for it. 

Every solution is unique, but as a general guiding principle, here’s the type of maintenance you’ll be responsible for in every cloud model.

* **Software as a service (SaaS)** solutions offer the least customization and thus leaves you with the lightest maintenance burden. There should be very little you need to do to maintain a SaaS, with the exception of keeping your own web browsers up to date.


* **Platform as a service (PaaS)** solutions give you full control over your own custom apps, and so you’re responsible for maintaining that code. You’ll need to keep making sure it still functions with modern clients and that it doesn’t have newly discovered vulnerabilities. 


* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** solutions offer a great deal of customization and thus require significant maintenance on your part. You’ll be responsible for things like identity management and network security in addition to everything at the PaaS level.

Maintenance is a shared responsibility between CSP and customer, and you should never assume something is (or isn’t) your responsibility. Every [FedRAMP](https://fedramp.gov/)-authorized CSP should have what’s called a “customer responsibility matrix” that will spell out who’s responsible for what and in which contexts. Ask your vendor to share theirs with you, and keep it on hand in case questions arise down the line.

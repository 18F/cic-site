Scaling, also referred to as “rapid elasticity,” is one of NIST’s [five essentials characteristics](/why-cloud/basics/) of cloud. A true cloud environment will be able to quickly provision anything you ask for — you should never “run out” of resources. (This is different from reaching a cap; a cap is an imposed limit that can be lifted, not a hard limit to what’s possible.) 

A decision to scale resources can be made either on the basis of something that’s already happened or something you know is likely to happen in the future. For instance, if you’ve noticed that your system load is reaching a point where it takes more than half a second to respond to your request, you might want to split your workload to reduce that latency time. Alternately, if you know traffic to your website will drastically increase at particular times of year (for instance, tax season or the holidays), you can scale up in advance of the busy season and scale down when the rush is over.

Scaling doesn’t have to be a manual process. Some systems offer autoscaling — they’ll automatically increase based on demand. The more resources you use, the more expensive your bill, so you should be able to cap your autoscaling based on a specific dollar amount. And of course, if you’re using a software as a service (SaaS) solution, scaling shouldn’t be something you need to think about at all. 

## Scaling your program
There’s another type of scaling you may need to think about, too — scaling your cloud migration program. In addition to any additional resource allocation, you’ll need to consider the best way to get staff skilled up on cloud. Does that involve making your initial cloud team a resource for other teams moving onto the cloud? Do you split the existing cloud team and embed those members throughout the organization? Do you bring on additional staff, either on site or as contractors? Eventually, IT transformation stops being a technical question and starts being a personnel question, and you’ll need to figure out what works best and most efficiently within the context of your organization.

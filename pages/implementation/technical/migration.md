Cloud migration is not a “one and done” process — an agency isn’t on-prem today and on the cloud tomorrow. In fact, some of the most successful agency transitions are designed from the start to be small, agile, and modular. By piloting and iterating over time, teams can develop the routines that work for them, while at the same time minimizing risk and building buy-in for the entire migration process.

Everyone’s modernization is different, but there are some best practices that hold true across agencies. Below is an overview of what you should keep in mind as you plan your migration, or bring on third parties to help the process along.

* **Start small**. Think about your first transition as a pilot — a chance to get the lay of the land, to learn and make mistakes, and to see how long things take. Many cloud solutions will let you test out their services for free; for example, GSA’s [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) offers a [free sandbox space](https://cloud.gov/overview/pricing/free-limited-sandbox/) to anyone with a valid federal e-mail address. 

   Whether you’re handling your agency’s transition yourself or bringing in a vendor to support, getting a sense of how to deploy apps in the cloud can be useful for anyone expecting to manage anything more custom than software as a service (SaaS). Even deploying a “Hello, world!” is a step towards that understanding.

* **Work backwards**. By the time you’re migrating actual programs you should already have your [audit of existing IT resources](/implementation/technical/), as well as rationalizations and risk assessments. Pick something simple and low risk for your first real migration or deployment, not a mission critical service. That way, your inevitable learning curve won’t interfere with mission goals, and you won’t to deal with added pressure you don’t need.


* **Refine your processes**. Don’t just move things to the cloud — pay attention to the way you move them. Keep track of every step along the way, and at the end of each migration, talk with your team about what worked and what didn’t. By experimenting with different ways of doing things, and by replicating your successes, you’ll be able to make each migration process a little better than the one before it. Think about which manual processes can be further automated.

* **Celebrate your successes**. Not everyone understands cloud, or its value, or why it’s work worth doing. Every time you successfully migrate, merge, or shut down a system, think about the impact your work will have on your overall agency. If your [FITARA](https://management.cio.gov/) score will increase or if your [DCOI](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/data-center-optimization-initiative-dcoi) targets will be met, make sure people know about it. See if you can use any cost savings to finance further cloud transitions, too.

Cloud adoption is bigger than just lift and shift — it’s an opportunity to reconsider the what, why, and how of the work you do. 

Starting small and building over time can help you determine the right products, the right services, and the right vendors to use. It can also help you demonstrate success early on, building support for IT modernization more broadly at your agency.

And once you figure out what works in pilots, you’ll need a plan to transition cloud services at scale: a template that works over and over again, for people as well as for processes.

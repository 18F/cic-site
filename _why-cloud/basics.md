If you’re just getting started with the cloud, the first thing to know is that there is no one “cloud.” Moving to the cloud isn’t as easy as unplugging your servers and uploading them to someone else’s; you’ll need to make choices about what kind of cloud service and deployment model will fit your mission needs. For more about why these categories exist, as well as the benefits they offer, see this section’s overview.

## What is cloud?

Different people have different definitions, but government follows guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST has identified these five [essential characteristics](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf) of cloud — and in order to be properly considered “cloud,” any third-party system must meet them.

  * **On-demand self-service** lets you provision and/or scale resources like server time or network storage on your own, whenever you want — you don’t need to work with an IT department or submit a help desk ticket.
* **Broad network access** gives you a variety of ways to access your resources outside of your organization’s network: mobile phones, tablets, laptops, workstations, etc.
* **Resource pooling** is where multiple users access a shared set of physical and virtual resources (storage, processing, memory, etc.) based on demand. 
* **Rapid elasticity** gives you the ability to scale your resources quickly, both outward and inward.
* **Measured service** automatically tracks your resource usage so that you pay for only what you actually use, rather than paying a flat access fee. 


## Cloud deployment

NIST has also defined four different types of cloud: public, private, hybrid, and community. 

* **Public clouds** allow multiple organizations — from both the public and private sectors — to access the same computing resources. This drives innovation, as well as economies of scale. 

It’s a mistake to assume public clouds aren’t secure; many public clouds are [FedRAMP-authorized](https://www.fedramp.gov/about/) and supported by large security teams, and industry relies on these types of clouds to keep their information safe. Unless the information you need to store is sensitive, a public cloud could easily meet your security requirements. If you do need additional data safeguarding, some cloud providers offer special government-only clouds that are “public” while still meeting higher levels of security and compliance.

* **Private clouds** offer the same characteristics as a public cloud, but because they’re only available to a single agency, they rarely offer the same benefits. A large part of what makes clouds more efficient is that computing resources are pooled; when an agency relies on its own private cloud, it sacrifices the efficiency and scale offered from pooled resources. Additionally, private clouds are more likely to be “cloud” in name only — services more accurately described as virtualization or outsourcing because they lack self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity or expansion. A notable exception is the CIA’s private cloud, which operates as a separate cloud region on CIA premises.


* **Hybrid clouds** are really multiple clouds working together, coordinated by a cloud broker that federates data, applications, user identity, security, and other details. Hybrid cloud providers are responsible for managing resources based on consumer requirements. As with a private cloud model, it’s important to make sure your “cloud” services actually make the most of cloud’s benefits; ask potential vendors about the five characteristics listed above.

* **Community clouds** are cloud resources shared by multiple (usually just a few) organizations with similar interests and requirements — for example, the defense or medical communities. It’s effectively a middle ground between a public and private cloud; some of the innovation and cost savings are still available because some of the resources are shared. Community clouds can be hosted on-prem by one agency or off-site via a third party.

In addition to a deployment model, you’ll have to decide what kind of service model best meets your needs. NIST has defined three cloud computing service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These different cloud models work together: underlying infrastructure supports platforms, and those platforms in turn support software.

## Cloud models

* **Infrastructure as a service** lets you outsource the physical parts of computing — power, cooling, racks, connectivity, and more. IaaS solutions give you full control over virtual machines, which can be both a positive and a negative: just like on-prem, the configuration is highly customizable, but just like on-prem, you need staff (or contractors) who can manage and maintain everything but the hardware. That includes operating systems, databases, and compliance, as well as any applications installed on top of the operating systems.


* **Platform as a service** lets you outsource both infrastructure and operations. With a PaaS, you’re not responsible for things like system administration, operating systems, or networking; you deploy your applications on top of a set of predetermined configurations. PaaS solutions are less customizable than IaaS solutions, but also require less staff time to maintain and support — especially in terms of security and compliance.

* **Software as a service** lets you outsource everything, including the code of the applications you use. You have very little responsibility for the software — you don’t need to worry about keeping it up to date, easy to use, or compliant — but in exchange, you have very little control over what it does or how it works. SaaS solutions, unlike other cloud models, tend to be end-user-facing.

No one cloud deployment or service model is fundamentally better than another — each offers unique functionality. However, depending on what you’re trying to accomplish, some deployment models may be better suited to your needs.

Thanks to its speed, scale, and capacity, the cloud offers more functionality with more automation than nearly every on-prem solution. This is for a few reasons:

  1. **Cloud is built around services**. The more you have on-prem, the more you and your technology need to be jacks-of-all-trades — you need to handle everything yourselves. But in cloud’s service-based model, instead of having one centralized group of servers and staff you have access to dozens of individualized services optimized for specific functions. That means people and tech: staff are focused on providing one discrete element of the cloud experience, and both hardware and software have been designed for performance.


  2. **Cloud is automated**. The computing power inherent to cloud means that everything mentioned above should be available to you on-demand and in a self-service manner — the experts involved should be behind the scenes, not in between you and the tech. (Remember, on-demand self-service is one of NIST’s five essential elements of cloud computing.) 


  3. **Cloud (usually) oversees your networking**. For the most part, networking — the joining up of resources within a cloud environment — will be managed by your cloud service provider (CSP). They have staff dedicated to this work, and as keepers of the infrastructure, they’ll be balancing your computing needs alongside their other service users’. That means someone else (or someone else’s computer) will be keeping an eye on optimizing the resources available to you. You’re free to configure to meet your needs, but the underlying functionality will be taken care of. 

In addition to new functionality, cloud computing offers new concepts and ways of working. Some of them are, somewhat confusingly, similar to terms you may have used in traditional IT environments. Here are some of the major technical terms you’re likely to encounter as you explore cloud computing. (Note: if you’re only planning to use Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, this information may be less relevant for you because you won’t have access to this level of customization.)

* **Containers are basically virtual machines**, just one step higher — they’re all running the same operating system. They’re faster to spin up and down, and faster to destroy after they’re done, than virtual machines. This makes them much more efficient while requiring fewer resources at the same time. 


* **Clusters** are, of course, virtual clusters; they follow the same rules as physical clusters, and they’re housed within a portion of a datacenter that’s been assigned to you. In a physical cluster you’re limited to the machines you have on-prem, and if one machine fails there can be ramifications on the rest of the system. Virtual clusters can be made of physical or virtual machines situated anywhere in the world, can be spun up and down on demand, and aren’t likely to be brought down by the failure of any one individual component.


* **Load balancing** provides automatic oversight over every instance of your production environment and makes sure no servers are receiving an undue amount of strain or reaching their capacity. This isn’t really possible on-prem — the increased latency and lack of scale wouldn’t be worth the investment.


* **Servers** in a cloud context typically mean “space rented on a server” (although some agencies, like the CIA, have their own separate servers entirely). Renting space on a server saves that resource for you until you say otherwise; you can scale up and down on demand, but there’s always capacity ready for you on a moment’s notice. 


* **Serverless**-enabled storage, on the other hand, refers to computing power that only exists for you when you need it. There is no “reserved” space for you; upon your request, a new instance is spun up for you and then destroyed when you’re done using it. Serverless storage tends to be more affordable but also slower than traditional servers.


* **Storage** in a traditional data center, whether databases or files, means having a physical computer with an operating system and a configuration to run your files. Storage on the cloud is fundamentally the same, but the resources aren’t usually located in the same place physically. The code might be somewhere in a place optimized to run code, the hardware might be somewhere else optimized to run hardware, and the operating system might be in a third place optimized to run operating systems. 


* **Virtualization** is effectively the same thing as having virtual machines (i.e., multiple instances of the same operating system on a physical computer). Instead of running these virtual machines yourself, however, your CSP will typically provide the virtualization for you. (Note: Software licensing can become sticky in virtualization, because providers may charge you based on how many virtual instances you have instead of how many physical computers you have — since you don’t own those computers yourself anymore.) 

As you complete your [cloud inventory and prioritization](/implementation/technical/migration/), make sure you take a deep dive into the capabilities cloud service providers have to offer. There’s likely to be functionality you didn’t have on-prem that could change your opinion about which services should be ported first. For example, records-keeping doesn’t seem like a particularly interesting system to port to the cloud — however, some cloud service providers offer exceptionally low-cost storage in exchange for high latency rates, which may be an acceptable trade-off for files you don’t plan to look at often (or ever). Think holistically about your needs, and then explore how cloud solutions could help meet them.

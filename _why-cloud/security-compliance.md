When it comes to cloud adoption, security is sometimes listed as a barrier (or at least a concern) to access. This comes from a misplaced belief that the cloud is less secure than the physical data centers agencies keep on premises. On the contrary, cloud services and facilities typically possess the proper security architecture and certifications to provide services for the government — and often have larger security teams than agencies can themselves support. 

But even the most secure cloud solution still requires you to maintain some security and compliance protocols on your end. Below is an overview of what that might look like for you, as well as some things to keep an eye out for.

## Responsibilities

The security and compliance you’re responsible for depends on what [type of cloud solution](/why-cloud/basics/) you procure. Software as a service (SaaS) users are typically responsible for very little; platform as a service users only have to secure their applications; on the other hand, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) users will have to secure platforms and software themselves. A good rule of thumb is that you’re usually responsible for what you can customize; if it’s automatically set up for you, your vendor is likely responsible for its security and compliance. (However, there are exceptions to this: for example, sometimes a vendor will provide the tools you need to maintain security and compliance, but it’ll be your responsibility to make sure that tool is used correctly.)

Understanding this shared responsibility model is fundamental to procuring and implementing cloud. That way, you know what you’re getting for your money — and you won’t be surprised down the line by requirements you thought were being covered by a vendor.

## FedRAMP

If your agency’s cloud migration is still in its early stages, or if you don’t have the capacity to manage an in-depth security and compliance process, consider limiting your search to solutions that are already FedRAMP-authorized. The [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. Under FedRAMP, a Joint Authorization Board or an Agency may issue a Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATP) for a cloud solution that you can leverage for your agency. 

FedRAMP has an established marketplace of solutions agencies need, and offers assistance and guidance to agencies as they transition to modern, secure cloud technologies. It’s  mandatory for U.S. federal cloud deployments and service models, and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandate states that agencies must “use FedRAMP when conducting risk assessments, security authorizations, and granting Authorities to Operate (ATO) for all executive department or agency use of cloud services.”
